# GWtuna
Fast Gravitational-Wave Serach: Trawling through the data to find gravitational waves (or fish)!

GWtuna requires JAX implementation on a GPU and installation of revelant modules stated in the Python scripts.  

This repository conatains: 
1) 3 GWtuna injection scripts searching for different parameter combinations. 
2) The Juypter notebook used to create the plots shown in the original paper. 
3) The Advanced LIGO O4 PSD that is used in the GWtuna injection script. 
4) Output (log file, csv for successfully recovered injections, and csv for unsuccessfully recovered injections).
